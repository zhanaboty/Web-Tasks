    <td style="font-size:140%;">The BMW M5 is a highperX variant of the BMW 5 Series marketed under the BMW M sub-brand.
      It is considered an iconic vehicle in the sports sedan category. The majority of M5's have been produced in the sedan (saloon)
      body style, however in some countries the M5 was also available as a wagon (estate) from 1992–1995 and 2006–2010.
The first M5 model was hand-built in 1985 on the E28 535i chassis with a modified engine from the M1 that made it the fastest production sedan at the time.
M5 models have been produced for every generation of the 5 Series since 1985.
Engine
The E39 M5 is powered by the BMW S62 V8 engine, which generates a power output of 294 kW (394 hp) at 6,600 rpm and 500 N⋅m (369 lb⋅ft) of torque at 3,800 rpm.
 The S62 engine has electronically-actuated individual throttle bodies, an aluminium block and heads, variable valve timing (double-VANOS), and a semi-dry sump oil system.</td>
